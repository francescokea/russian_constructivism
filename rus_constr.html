            The last and most influential modern art movement in Russia in the 20th century.
        </h2>
        <p>
            In the early 1900s, several revolutionary directions in art and design began, for later to develop into
            modernism, which today we know so well from the majority of the design we surround ourselves in our everyday lives.
            But at that time there were thoughts that art should not be reserved for the upper class. That art can be constructed,
            abstract, without ornaments, new and provocative and for the people.

            The beginning of actual Modernism
        </h2>
        <p id="p2part1">
            One might argue that Russia first came up with the new modernist
            ideas. Russian futurism served as the basis for the new art form. It initially led to Russian constructivism
            and later to 'der Stijl' and 'Bauhaus' in the West. Bauhaus is today considered to be the cradle of modernism. Within
            constructivism this meant that, in essence, the expressive personal touch was rejected, looking away from the
            illustrative and hand-made expressions. One sought for pure and universal expression. Ie. ornaments were
            removed from the design and they saw the simple geometric shapes as an objective reality in itself.

            It was created by the
            Russian avant-garde but quickly spread to the entire continent.

            Lissitzky is especially known for his famous propaganda poster where
            a red triangle, symbolizing the Communist rebel movements, pierces a white circle that would symbolize the Bolsheviks.

            Lissitzky later travelled to the West, where he moved the constructivist ideals into the art group 'De Stijl'.

            The movement in everyday life

        <p id="section3">
            Constructivism influenced architecture, poetry, music, and even the consumer market and became the new everyday life in
            Russia of the time. In the mid-1930s the end of Russian constructivism began when Stalin ordered art to be realistic and
            not abstract, ie. the opposite of constructivism's foundations and ideas, which were instead replaced by socialist
            realism.

            The polyvalent Rodchenko

        <p>
            Alexander Rodchenko (1891-1956) is another famous artist in Russian constructivism. He started his career painting, then he worked
            with graphic design, and later he worked with the photograph. His photographs were socially engaged and innovative. He
            often shot his photos from an unusual angle, high above or below to shock the viewer. He wrote:</p> <blockquote id="rodquote"> "One has to take
            several different shots of a subject, from different points of view and in different situations, as if one examined it
            in the round rather than looked through the same key-hole again and again."</blockquote> <p> In his work on graphic design, he sought the
            unambiguous universal form. His work is characterized by its dynamics and energy.

        <p>
            Gustav Klutsis (1895 &#45; 1938) is claimed
            to together with Hannah H&ouml;ch, Raoul Hausmann and El Lissitzky to have created the subgenre <strong> 'Political photomontage'</strong>.

        <img src="klut.jpg" alt="" id="klutimg">
        <p>
            A subgenre that originated in 1918. The ongoing theme in his works is propaganda and revolution. His first remarkable piece
            of work was a series of removable kiosks that were installed on the streets of Moscow in 1922. The kiosks were equipped
            with radio speakers, screens showing movies, and newspapers. The installation should mark the <strong> 5th anniversary of the
            Russian Revolution.</strong>

        of Russian constructivism are typically geometric, clean and straight forms. Ie. within the
        classification, it will typically be a <span class="sansserif"> sans&#45;serif</span>: <br> no feet, ornaments or swung curves and no contrasts in the line,
        which means that the line has the same thickness throughout the letter. Headings can be crooked in an often diagonal
        expression. One sought for a universal and pure expression, where all ornaments were removed.

        and
        especially the primary colours were to be preferred. In Russian constructivism, we especially see the red colours which
        became a symbol of the people's revolution. In addition, black and white, where the <br><span class="white">White</span> is not a pure white but a
        cracked white, due to the fact that it did not print the white colour but let the paper shine through. The paper was not
        bleached white as we know it today but was more like a cracked white we know today from, for example, natural
        paper. There were often only two colours in a design used together with the black and chapped white.

       Simple and powerful in their expression, the layout can be both static in its structure ie. almost symmetrical or
    have dynamic and diagonal compositions. Sharp and geometric shapes characterize the design. Illustrations are not used in
    Russian constructivism, but on the other hand, photographs are used as a collage element. Posters often have strong
    messages.

        TODAY

    <p>
        The street artist Shepard Fairey and the band Franz Ferdinand are some of the contemporary artists who have
        clear and direct references to Russian Constructivism in their visual arts.But the term in today's context receives a
        different content and message than the highly propagandist and revolutionary message it had at that time of its origin.
